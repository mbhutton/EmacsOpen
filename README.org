#+title: EmacsOpen.app (Vaporware)
* Main idea
"Open thing in Emacs, do what I mean."

Share and open files, web links, web page selection (Safari), and =org-protocol://= links in Emacs on macOS, starting the Emacs daemon and opening a frame if necessary.
* Status: Planning / Vaporware
* Potential roadblocks
** Can an unsigned macOS app invoke =emacsclient= to connect to Emacs when running?
Potential issues with permissions, and environment variables. Fails within Shortcuts.app.
** Can an unsigned macOS app start and stop a brew service?
Potential permissions issues.
* Background
This started as a discussion on an [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus/pull/783][Emacs Plus PR]] thread.
